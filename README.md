# bloc_app

A new Flutter project using BLoc.
The Goal was to see how BLoc compares to GetX && Provider for me.

-- More Creativity Could be added to this project.

## Creative Ideas
    - FAB at Homepage to add new Grocery item.
    - FAB Show fade in on scroll-down and fade out on scroll-up
    - Multiple product images.
    - Open image viewer when user taps on image.
    - Have Badges on Navbar actions to show items added to pages count/length.
    - Dark theme.. (It's a thing to consider mos..)
    - Cache Images
    
## Can Be Improved
    - Update Home items when an item is removed from another page.

- Take up this challenges to do something better if you'd like.
